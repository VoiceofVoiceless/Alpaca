flow control

gather data
    publicly sourced data crawling fed into data crunching
    

interpret data
    utilize publicly well understood indicators to analyze available market data relevant to interconnected assets [bollinger's bands, ]

determine entry and exit points
    indicator based real time analysis of assets to predict the most likely entry and exit points for local min/max on specific assets relative to current implied volatility and similar historic trends.

analyze trader movement
    portfolio analysis of possible moves to be made by publicly determinable asset data [float, shares held by players, number of players, block trade analysis, short float, margin calls]
    incorporate institutional algo/strategies to determine risk of large coordinated movements of indicator, sentiment or other conditional market movements


Data Acquisition and Preparation:


Alpaca API Integration: You'll need to install the Alpaca API client library (pip install alpaca-trade-api).  Obtain your API keys and secret keys from your Alpaca account. The API allows you to fetch historical and real-time market data, including options data.



Data Storage:  Decide how you'll store your data.  A relational database (like PostgreSQL or SQLite) is a good option for structured data like stock prices and options chains.  For large datasets or faster access, consider a NoSQL database like MongoDB.



Data Cleaning and Feature Engineering: This is crucial.  You'll need to handle missing data, outliers, and potentially transform your raw data into features useful for your prediction models. This might involve calculating technical indicators (RSI, MACD, Bollinger Bands, etc.), creating rolling averages, or deriving fundamental ratios from financial statements.


II. Quantitative Market Dynamic Prediction:


Option Pricing Models: Research and implement one or more option pricing models (Black-Scholes, binomial trees, etc.) to estimate fair value and identify potential mispricings.  You'll need to consider factors like implied volatility, time to expiration, and interest rates.



Predictive Models: Choose statistical or machine learning models to predict short-term market movements.  Examples include:


Time Series Models: ARIMA, GARCH for predicting price trends.
Machine Learning Models: Regression models (linear, ridge, lasso), support vector machines (SVMs), neural networks. Consider using historical option prices and market data to train these models.


Backtesting:  Thoroughly backtest your chosen models using historical data to evaluate their performance and assess risk before deploying them in live trading.  Alpaca's API should provide historical data for this purpose.  Key metrics include Sharpe ratio, Sortino ratio, maximum drawdown, and win rate.


III. Stock Portfolio Management (Weekly Review):


Quantitative and Value Metrics: Decide on the specific quantitative and value metrics you'll use to evaluate your stock basket (e.g., P/E ratio, PEG ratio, debt-to-equity ratio, dividend yield, etc.).



Screening and Selection:  Implement a system to screen stocks based on your chosen metrics and select those that meet your criteria.  Alpaca's API can provide fundamental data on stocks, but you might need to supplement it with data from other sources (e.g., financial APIs).



Rebalancing:  Define a strategy for rebalancing your stock portfolio weekly.  This might involve selling underperforming stocks and buying those that meet your updated criteria.

IV. Algo Structure:

Time interval updated trade monitor with human prompted execution to verify trade indicators against extraneous data and volatile confidence.

V. Risk Management:

Position Sizing:  Implement appropriate position sizing to limit potential losses on any single trade.
Stop-Loss Orders:  Use stop-loss orders to automatically exit positions if the price falls below a certain level.
Paper Trading:  Thoroughly backtest and test your algorithm in a paper trading environment before risking real capital.
This is a high-level outline.  Each step involves considerable detail and requires expertise in finance, programming, and machine learning. Remember to always prioritize risk management and thoroughly backtest your strategies before live trading.  Start small, focus on one aspect at a time, and gradually build your algorithm's complexity.
